# domeParticles
Start of some basic particle stuff using Bean's HID profile as a trigger. 

Made for Exporations 2016, DFIG. 

This uses a lightblue bean in HID mode to mimic a keyboard, and an Adafruit 8 Key Cap sensor breakout (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1602). Visuals are made in Processing. The sensors themselves are pads of conductive fabric.
